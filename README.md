Tile-matching RPG puzzle game for the Nintendo GameBoy released in 2014.

Took about 4 months to write in 100% assembly. Builds with WLA-DX. Simple on the outside, crazy on the inside !

Warm thanks to everyone who played it, and to those who bought the physical release without directly putting it on eBay for $80 :)
